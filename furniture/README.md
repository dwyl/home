There are at _least_ 100 individual pieces of furniture
that need to be built (_or in some cases bought_) for the house.


If we "walk through" the house starting at the main entrance,
we can list all the items that need to be made (_or bought_):

# First (Middle) Floor

## Entrance:
1. Entrance shoe rack - so people avoid wearing outside dirt into the house.
There will be space for at _least_ 32 individual spaces.
Each "cubby" will be
2. Entrance living wall (inside) and "***welcome home***" **sign**.

Our "Welcome Home" sign will be similar to this:

Our sign will be cut on the CNC (_obvs_) and mounted with LEDs so it "pops":

## Middle floor corridor:

3. Mail sorting and "pigeon hole" rack to organise mail and packages for long-term guests.
4. Shopping bag and loyalty card storage - tbd but I think it makes sense
to store shopping bags and local supermarket loyalty cards
neatly in the entrance with a small sign asking/reminding people
"going shopping?", take one of the re-useable carrier bags.
5. _Analogue_ community wall (between library and bathroom)
where people can share their love and creativity.

## Library:

6. Library shelving covers the north wall.
(_not adding more library shelving until we **need** it._)
7. "Secret" library door (_which won't be a secret after the video is published ... but will still look amazing!_)
8. Ergonomic Fold-up Desk so Library can be used as a meeting room
see: https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/332#issuecomment-374660800
9. Ergonomic Reading Chairs (x2)

Note: We will prob just get IKEA POANG chairs as a stopgap.
But when we have time to design a more comfortable and easy to CNC chair,
we will.


## Main Staircase:

10. "Reading nook" L-shaped sofa (_under the main staircase_)
9. Welcome screen (_integrated into the wall_)
10. Main staircase living wall (behind/above reading nook)
11. Device testing station (_the door at the base of stairs_) - a rack of mobile devices for testing our app(s). <br />
e.g: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=device+testing+station

## Kitchen:

14. Small appliance and Storage shelves
15. Lockable infrequent use appliance storage above "drinks fridge":
https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/82
14. "Main" L-shaped kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/56
15. Spice Rack - on end of the island of main kitchen
16. Wall-mounted drying/airing rack for hand-washed items drains into main sink.
17. "Long" (Pool view) kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/55
18. Recycling, composting and trash center under right side of long kitchen.
19. Wheelchair accessible kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/54
20. Indoor herb garden/wall

## Laundry/Utility Room

23. Laundry organisation/storage
24. Overhead drying rack

## Dining Room

25. Dining table (x4) - this will require a decent amount of thought
to create a _system_ that allows us to use each table independently
but also configure them into a single table for our community meals.
26. Dining Benches (x8) 3-4 people can sit on each bench
27. Dining Chairs (x8)
28. Living wall.
29. Device charging bank. (_our dining room will be a "no screens" environment_)


## Co-working / Learning Room

30. Sit-stand desk (x20) https://github.com/nelsonic/standing-desk
I expect that once designed (8h) each desk will take 1h to create on the CNC
My plan is to make it flat-packable and easy to assemble.
All desks will be on castors (wheels) so that they are easy to move about.
31. Chairs TBD. Designing a great work chair is _difficult_!
I'm definitely up for the challenge, and think it's a worth my time,
but I don't consider it a priority
because there are reasonably priced chairs
we can use in the mean time.
