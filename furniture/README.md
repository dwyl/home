There are at _least_ 100 individual pieces of furniture
that need to be built (_or in some cases bought_) for the house.


If we "walk through" the house starting at the main entrance,
we can list all the items that need to be made (_or bought_):

# First (Middle) Floor

## Entrance:
1. Entrance shoe rack - so people avoid wearing outside dirt into the house.
There will be at _least_ 32 individual spaces.
Each "cubby" will be numbered cante
and automatically fold away neatly to avoid clutter.
2. Entrance living wall (inside) and "***welcome home***" **sign**.

Our "Welcome Home" sign will be similar to this:

Our sign will be cut on the CNC (_obvs_) and mounted with LEDs so it "pops":

## Middle floor corridor:

3. Mail sorting and "pigeon hole" rack
to organise mail and packages for longer-term guests.
4. Shopping bag and loyalty card storage - tbd.
I think it makes sense
to store shopping bags and local supermarket loyalty cards
neatly in the entrance with a small sign asking/reminding people
"going shopping?", take one of the re-useable carrier bags
and the loyalty card so they get discounts.
5. _Analogue_ community wall (between library and bathroom)
where people can share their love and creativity.



## Library:

6. Library shelving covers the north wall.
(_not adding more library shelving until we **need** it._)
7. "Secret" library door (_which won't be a secret after the video is published ... but will still look amazing!_)
8. Ergonomic Fold-up Desk so Library can be used as a meeting room
see: https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/332#issuecomment-374660800
9. Ergonomic Reading Chairs (x2)

Obviously we'll _never_ pay €1475 for a _single_ chair.
This is just an example of a stylish chair.

We will probably just get IKEA POANG chairs as a stopgap.
But when we have time to design a more comfortable and easy to CNC chair,
we will.

I quite like the idea of a reading net suspended above head height:

It would be quite cheap to make ($20) using industrial safety netting:

## Main Staircase:

10. "Reading nook" L-shaped sofa (_under the main staircase_)
9. Welcome screen (_integrated into the wall_)
10. Main staircase living wall (behind/above reading nook)
11. Device testing station (_the door at the base of stairs_) - a rack of mobile devices for testing our app(s). <br />
e.g: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=device+testing+station

## Kitchen:

14. Small appliance and Storage shelves
15. Lockable infrequent use appliance storage above "drinks fridge":
https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/82
14. "Main" L-shaped kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/56
15. Spice Rack - on end of the island of main kitchen
16. Wall-mounted drying/airing rack for hand-washed items drains into main sink.
17. "Long" (Pool view) kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/55
18. Recycling, composting and trash center under right side of long kitchen.
19. Wheelchair accessible kitchen: https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/54
20. Indoor herb garden/wall

## Laundry/Utility Room

23. Laundry organisation/storage (_for clean clothes_)
24. Overhead drying rack with pulley

## Dining Room

25. Dining table (x4) - this will require a decent amount of thought
to create a _system_ that allows us to use each table independently
but also configure them into a single table for our community meals.
26. Dining Benches (x8) 3-4 people can sit on each bench
27. Dining Chairs (x8)
28. Living wall (_adjacent to co-working room_) with integrated bluetooth speakers and lighting.
29. Device charging bank. (_our dining room will be a "no screens" environment_) People will leave their phones charging while they are eating.


## Co-working / Learning Room

30. Sit-stand desk (x20) https://github.com/nelsonic/standing-desk
I expect that once I've invested the time researching and designing (1 week)
each desk will take 1h to create on the CNC.
My plan is to make it flat-packable and _easy_ to assemble.
All desks will be on castors (wheels) so that they are easy to move about.
I've made 6 desks from scratch already
so I'm very familiar with the ergonomics.
The biggest challenge
31. Chairs TBD. Designing a great work chair is _difficult_!
I'm definitely up for the challenge, and think it's a worth my time,
but I don't consider it a priority
because there are reasonably priced chairs
we can use in the mean time.


# Basement

## Reduced Mobility room

32. Murphy bed (_using linear actuators_)
2. Wardrobe
3. Additional wall-mounted fold down single bed for child/guest/carer.


## Recording Studio (_Formerly "Media Room"_)

35. Overhead recording desk for top-down shots.
2. Video editing desk.
3. Mini sofa (_tight fit but essential_)

## Leisure Room

42. 4 x 2-seater sofas with integrated storage
2. 4 x L-shaped sofas in corners of room
3. Plant wall covering the whole west wall.
The projector screen will descend from the ceiling
and temporarily cover the plants when in use.
The idea is that the room is used for non-media socialising
and as an additional "chill" area during the day.

All sofas will be on castors so repositionable for movie night.

# 2nd Floor

## Bedrooms

42. 16 bunk beds with integrated lighting and storage.
see: https://github.com/nelsonic/bunk-bed

## Houseparent Tiny House

42. Bed https://github.com/nelsonic/braga-houseparent-tiny-home
2. Step ladder to loft
3. Sofa
4. Wardrobe
5. Custom desk with _lots_ of storage



# Top Floor

42. 3 x double bed frames with integrated storage
43. 3 x Built-in wardrobes
45. Landing L-shaped sofa
