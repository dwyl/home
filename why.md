# Why?

Our reasoning for _why_ we want to build a ***`@home`***
where people in the @dwyl community can live, learn, get/stay well
and work on something meaningful is simple: we want this for _ourselves_.

When we graduated from High School / University,
there was no place we could go/live
that was focussed on health/wellness
and where we could learn the skills
we needed for the 21<sup>st</sup> century
surrounded by _like-minded motivated_ people.
If ***`@home`*** had _existed_
when we left our parents houses
and/or when we graduated from University,
we would have jumped at the opportunity!

We are _building_ what we _wish_ already existed!



## Why _Renovate_ an "Old" House?

Several people
(_including our main building contractor and foreman_)
have mentioned
that the total cost
to renovate an _abandoned_ older house
is very near to the cost
of building from _scratch_.
This is because with an older house the:
+ **plumbing** has likely _cracked_
due to both use and disuse.
  + pipes are probably made of materials
  that include lead and are
+ **electrical circuit** will _definitely_ need re-wiring
firstly because wires/cables in older houses
usually degrade over time
and secondly because they were not properly grounded
when they were originally installed
so the circuits were not safe.
+ **all windows** need to be _replaced_
both for thermal and noise insulation.
+ **Walls** need to be repaired after
the new electrical conduit and cables are installed.

The fact that renovation is _expensive_
is one we are _painfully_ aware of
but it is also one we _embrace wholeheartedly_;
renovating an _existing_ abandoned/unused house
is the _right_ thing to do
both for _us_
for the _environment_
and the _country_.

## 20% Of Houses in Portugal are Abandoned

In Portugal, there are an estimated **735,000 vacant/abandoned houses**. <br />
Rui Almeida has some _incredible_ photos
of abandoned mansions: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruialmeida

e.g: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ruialmeida/46333296912/
![rui-almeida-abandoned-house](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50672256-efa8af80-0fce-11e9-904e-8f9a55c2ea9e.png)

This Mail article is a good summary of the problem: <br />
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4028126/Portugal-mansions-sit-abandoned-photos-reveal-dilapidated-remains-half-lived.html

![portugal-vacant-properties](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50629807-123aba00-0f36-11e9-9a75-03a33aeb7aa1.png)

Not that you (_or anyone_) should/not read the Daily Mail ... 🙄 <br />
But the fact that "_mainstream media_" has covered the issue,
should indicate that it's a _real_ problem.

![10-million-people](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50630939-75c6e680-0f3a-11e9-8165-545e6fe3f5e4.png)

Portugal has **10 Million** people and 3.6 Million households,
an average household size of 2.5 people. 735k/3.6M = **20.4%** ... 😮
Approximately **one _fifth_** of the total housing stock
of the country is _abandoned_!

This is a _real_ problem because not only are the abandoned houses an eyesore
on the landscape, they take up valuable space in prime locations!
We feel that we need
to be part of the _solution_
to the abandoned buildings problem.
We need to show _leadership_
in renovating/restoring buildings
and bring them back into the "housing stock"
so that people who currently cannot afford
to live in Portugal's cities
can have a space to call their own.

## AirBnB is a Greedy Landlord's _Dream_

In Portugal's major cities -
including Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Coimbra and Braga -
Landlords are using AirBnB
to rent entire apartments to tourists.

### 76% of Listings on AirBnB are _Entire_ Homes

According to AirBnB's official "overview" for 2016,
**76%** of listings on the platform are for **_entire_ homes** or apartments.

![76-percent-entire-home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50674226-19b49e80-0fdc-11e9-8601-afd932eec1bc.png)

This is **`public`** information
published by AirBnB themselves.
AirBnB is _systematically accelerating_
the _unaffordability_
of homes
to _local_ residents.
It is _clear_ that the platform
is _not_ being used by people
renting out a "spare bed" in their home.
People who _live_ in an apartment
do not rent out the _entire_ apartment
for 84 nights per year
because otherwise they don't have anywhere to _sleep_!
The _vast majority_ of listings
are owned/operated by _professional_ landlords
or "property investors".


AirBnB's _official_ stats
indicate that a "typical host"
earns an _average_ of €7,000/year for 84 nights:
[2016_EIS_Lisbon-Portugal_EN.pdf](https://www.airbnbcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2017/05/2016_EIS_Lisbon-Portugal_EN.pdf)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50673108-bb83bd80-0fd3-11e9-9a40-01b71bb554ed.png)

€7000 / 84 = **€83 / night**
or
€7000 / 12 = **€583 / month**
This may appear to be
"good value for money"
to a tourist or "digital nomad",
but it's _completely_ out of reach
for a _local_.

A typical 2 bedroom apartment in Lisbon
used to be available to _locals_
for **€300/month**.
If the Landlord can get **€583/month**
without much more work.

The **66%** guest **growth rate** the report _highlights_
should

Prices have been pushed up _way_
beyond what locals can pay
see:
https://www.euronews.com/2017/09/19/lisbon-s-tourism-magnet-is-kicking-out-local-residents -

We are not "against" the tourism influx,
we recognise that Portugal _needs_ visitors
for the economy to continue thriving.
We are _against_ greedy landlords and opportunistic developers
evicting  local people out of their flats/houses
in order to jack up prices on AirBnB.
Working families are being made _homeless_
so that landlords can make more _profits_.
This is _wrong_ and should be regulated by authorities
to avoid locals being completely priced out.



> To be **100% clear** we are not hypocritically
> "throwing stones" at landlords.
> We **own** homes where we do not live.
> The homes we own are not "empty";
> they are rented by people
> who either do not _want_ to buy
(_because they have not finalised where they want to live long-term_)
or have not saved enough for a deposit.
> We _deliberately_ set the rent
of the houses we own _below_ the "market rate"
and do _not_ increase rents the way greedy landlords do.
We are _not_ trying to accumulate a "property empire"
to extract as much economic rent from working families.
The only "property" we own were once our principal private residences.
i.e. we bought a "run down" house, renovated it,
_lived_ in the house for 2+ years
and after we moved on,
instead of selling we decided to make the house/apartment
available to others who need a place to live.
We have not acquired property as investment exclusively for a return.

# tl;dr / Work-in-Progress

> **Please NOTE**: following section
is NOT intended
as a "criticism" or "disrespect"
of any particular _individual_ person.
It is purely an _observation_ that I want to _capture_.
I want to _highlight_ the fact that some people don't _understand_
what we are trying to build **`@home`** and that is a _good_ thing!
It's a _sign_ that: <br />
> a) *We* are not doing a good enough job of sharing our _vision_. <br />
> b) The person/people simply does/do not _want_ to think about the future
or empathise with others who are less fortunate than them. <br />
If people don't _want_ to understand
what we are trying to achieve
or don't _want_ to think about their own environmental impact
or the selfishness of their lives, that's totally "OK".
Each person has the right to live their life as they see fit.
I/we _chose_ to live our lives in a way that _benefits everyone_.


## A _Sure_ Sign We are "Onto Something"

> "_If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it_."
~ Albert Einstein

As an entrepreneur,
one of the _best_ signs
that you have an _innovative_ idea
is that _some_ people simply don't "_get_" it.
No matter how much you try to _explain_ it to them,
they simply don't have the imagination/empathy
to understand that even though _they_ are not the "_target user_",
there are _thousands/millions_ of _other_ people
who _do_ want the product/service
you are creating.

> For **example**:
When Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk
pitched their idea of an "_Air Bed and Breakfast_"
to Fred Wilson in 2009,
he _loved_ them as founders,
but tried to convince them to work on a different idea.
Paul Graham, arguably one of the greatest startup investors,
did not "get" the idea of renting
a bed in your own home to a _stranger_ through a website.
Paul asked the founders the following question: <br />
> “_People are actually doing this? Why? **What’s wrong with them**?_” <br />
8 years later AirBnB is _by far_ the most valuable company
in the YCombinator portfolio:

Over the last year
we have _verbally_ explained
the idea of ***`@home`***
to _many_ people.
_Most_ of those people
have _immediately_ understood
and _loved_ the idea
even if they are _not_ a "target user".
But a _handful_ have been _confused_ by it.

One person in _particular_,
who will remain nameless to avoid "embarrassing" them,
_really_ didn't "_get_" the idea at _all_!
They only understood the idea in terms
they could _already_ envision.
They would say "_it's a **hostel**_" ...

They simply did not have the _imagination_
to _understand_ the concept of
"_co-living_",
"_location-independent working_"
or "_life-long learning_".
It is _inconceivable_ to them that anyone
would _voluntarily want_ to live
with like-minded and _interesting_ people.
It's equally _unimaginable_
that people would _want_ to learn new things
or do something they _love_ for a living.

The person lives in a _mansion_
of similar size to the Braga ***`@home`***
and has an _empty_ (_lonely/sad_) life
they attempt to fill with TV, shopping and gossip.
No real _substance_.  Nothing _creative_, innovative or original.

The person has been working the same paper-pushing job
for _several_ years and _complains_ about it _constantly_.
Each time they complain about their "boss" or their lack of pay increase,
we say: "_**quit** your job_!"
(_the person has more than enough money to retire or retrain,
  but is **terrified** of being alone with their own thoughts,
  so instead relies on having a job to keep their days/mind occupied._)

The fact is this:
if some people don't _immediately_ understand your idea,
that's a _really good_ sign!
If _everyone_ gets it,
then it is not very original.

### Why We _MUST_ Live & Work `@home`

The person does not "_get_" what we are trying to build
keeps _insisting_ that we (Inês and I)
should _not_ live in the home when it's ready.
They keep saying that we should rent/buy an apartment nearby.
They don't _understand_ that we are trying to build a _community_,
_not_ a "passive income business".
They don't _understand_ the _first_ principal of design thinking process:
empathy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking#Empathy

![design-thinking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/50629517-c8050900-0f34-11e9-8d57-3e3b0484fb25.png) <br />
via: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking


Designing a home for someone _`else`_ to live in
(_without living in it ourselves_)
will not be anywhere _near_ as effective
as actually _living_ there _full-time_
so that we can test all aspects
and feel any "_pain points_" first-hand.

> The biggest problem with _existing_
developer-lead for-profit co-living complexes - <br />
such as "**The Collective**" in London
which an ex-resident described as
"***Horrible, horrible place***." <br />
see: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16911318 - <br />
is that they are designed by people
who _don't_ live in the building/community.
The people _living_ in the building are Tenants
and are _powerless_ to _improve_ the building/community
because the company that owns it cares about one thing only: profit.


Their lack of empathy is due to the fact
that they have _never_ done
_any_ creative problem solving work in their lives.
People who do not _want_ to empathise with others,
will _only_ see the world through their own lens.
They _chose_ not to _understand_
that there are _many_ people
who do not share their perspective.
Yet, by _definition_ the world
is _full_ people who do _not_ share your _exact_ point of view.
Places with only _one_ view point are
