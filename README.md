# Project/Company Name: `home`<small><sup>1</sup></small>

<sup>1</sup> **`home`** is our "_working title_"; we're open to suggestions!
We've discussed _crowd-sourcing_ the name from our community,
but for now, this is easier and it kinda "works" for what we are doing.
There is built-in "brand recognition"
in the common expression "_Working from **`home`**_".
And there's an "emoji" and free "font awesome icon" so we don't need to think
about "branding" and can instead focus on building the _community_.

<hr />


### Company URL: https://dwyl.com/home

<!--
Note: this is a _suggestion_.
I intend to make this doc available as a "landing page" on
https://dwyl.com/home
If you have a better idea, please advise!
I don't have a "strong preference" was just being pragmatic.

## Description

##### Describe your company in a sentence or two. `<input maxlength="60">`

We are a Female Founder-Focussed Co-Living/Learning Home [57 characters]

We have worked in the technology industry
in several roles for the past 10 years,
everything from non-profit and 2-10 person micro co.
to 400k person "mega-corp"
and high-growth startup: 100 >> 10k (people) growth. <br />

We have built MVPs for, advised and trained people in _several_ startups. <br />
We feel we have a _grasp_ of what it takes to run a successful technology startup.
(_though we expect to gain significantly more wisdom on the subject through
  participating in Startup School and possibly YC's "main" program_).
We have lived the "digital nomad" (remote working) lifestyle and
know what the biggest challenges are.

### Female Founder Focus ?

Being a female founder, we know it is
_often_ more difficult to get ideas off the ground.
We have felt the pain of female founders coming to us (@dwyl) to build their MVP
because male-dominated "dev agencies"
did not take them or their ideas seriously.

![female-founder-conference-qa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/44026506-3030c5c4-9eeb-11e8-9890-ef01a95fe450.png)

We _applaud_ the tremendous work done by Jessica Livingston
and other YC partners to organise the Female Founders Conference and
_aspire_ to be _invited_ on stage in a few years time.
We want to help _accelerate_ the ascent of other female founders
by giving them a space to _start_ their journey (_before they apply to YC!_)

## Vertical

We feel that the "vertical" category that most reflects our project
is "***community***" closely followed by "***diversity***".



There are **36 options** for "Vertical" on the Startup School application form.
<!--
see:
https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/511#issuecomment-412265192
-->

**`home`** does not "_neatly_ fit" into anyone of them
rather it encompasses several:
+ `<option value="7">Community</option>` because we are building a community.

+ `<option value="8">Consumer</option>` because our "product"
is "consumer" focussed; our customers are "consumers".

+ `<option value="10">Developer Tools</option>` because we will be building
several open source tools that will help other developers realise their ideas!

+ `<option value="11">Diversity</option>` because we are focussed on
ladies in tech and other under-represented groups.

+ `<option value="14">Education</option>` we are not building an "EdTech"
company, however we are giving people _access_ to peer-lead tech learning
which, from experience, can be _far_ more effective
than traditional schools/university for learning tech skills.

<!--
+ `<option value="20">Hardware</option>` we will be building all our
door-access hardware from scratch using open source hardware and software.
e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/door (_though this is not our "core product"_)
-->

+ `<option value="21">Healthcare</option>` because we are promoting
a sustainably healthy lifestyle and equipping people with strategies
to _get_ healthy for people who have poor habits.

+ `<option value="22">International Market</option>` because we
intend to be _global_.

+ `<option value="23">Jobs</option>` we will _create_ jobs
(_where we employ people directly_)
and help train people with skills they need to _get_ jobs in tech.

+ `<option value="26">Moonshots / Hard Tech</option>` we feel that building
an App to help people engage with their community is solving a "Hard" problem.
It's not a "moonshot" but it is difficult to get _right_.

+ `<option value="27">Nonprofit</option>` we will be _profitable_
but not _focussed_ on profits. And Open Sourcing all our code/systems
means that _anyone_ can "copy" our model which means we
can multiply the (positive) impact.

+ `<option value="30">Security</option>` We will be building both virtual and
physical security systems. We are not "pitching" ourselves
as a "security company" however security _is_ at the "core" of everything we do!

+ `<option value="36">Travel</option>` last but not least
we _definitely_ qualify as a "travel" company because people will
come from all over the world to stay at **`home`**.
Our aim is for our App to include travel and "what to do/visit" advice.
It will transcend the physical locations (operated by us)
and be used _ubiquitously_ for human interaction
(_without data mining and Ads!_). Again, this is not the "focus" for MVP.

<hr />

## Make

##### What is your company going to make? `<textarea maxlength="200">`

**`home`** is a female founder focussed co-living/learning house
where people live, learn & work on "something people want".
By-product: Mobile App for community, door-access, lights & resource sharing.
[197 chars]

> Getting this down to 200 characters is _hard_...!!

Had to cut:

We intend to use Wifi/BLE beacons to give ***location-contextual UI***
to the users so they get relevant info through the **`home`**
e.g: light switches, curtains, teleconference room bookings
and kitchen/bathroom availability.
People will share recipes (_public or private_)
and meal plans (_house-specific_) inviting others to partake in meals!

<hr />

## Why?

##### Why did you pick this to work on? `<textarea maxlength="250">`

**`home`** is what we wish we had when we started in the tech industry.
A place to meet, live and learn with peers
and a mentoring/support network throughout our career.
We are passionate about fostering the next generation of tech
workers & founders.


<hr />

## Commitment: Full-time

##### Are you currently part-time or full-time on this startup?

Options available:
```html
<select class="select required" name="company[commitment]" id="company_commitment">
<option value=""></option>
--
  | <option value="full_time">Full Time (40+ hours a week)</option>
  | <option value="part_time">Part Time (20+ hours a week)</option>
  | <option value="other_commitment">Other</option></select>
```

If there was an option for "_double-full-time_" i.e. **80+** hours/week,
we would pick that. <br />
For the foreseeable future, **`home`** is our _life_!


## _Progress_: Idea

##### Which of the following best describes your progress?

```html
<select class="select required" name="company[stage]" id="company_stage">
<option value=""></option>
--
  | <option value="nothing">Nothing Built</option>
  | <option value="idea">Idea/sketches</option>
  | <option value="mocks">Mocks/Renderings</option>
  | <option value="prototype">Prototype/pre-launch</option>
  | <option value="private_beta">Private Beta</option>
  | <option value="public_beta">Public Beta</option>
  | <option value="preorders">Taking Preorders</option>
  | <option value="launched">Launched</option></select>
```

The **`<option>`** that most accurately reflects
the progress of our App is "**Idea**".

Given that our project involves a **_physical_ building**
which is still "_under construction_",
and there isn't an **`<option>`** in the list for "***building site***",
the best description at this stage is "idea".

We intend to use the Startup School time to start building the Mobile App (PWA)
which will be used by the people _staying_ in **`home`**.

We expect the building works to be done by the end of September
and the first "MVP" members to join us in October 2018.
We are able to "Alpha UX Test" the app with friends & co-workers before we open
the _physical_ **`home`**.


We have a team of professional construction workers and tradesmen
taking care of the physical building so we feel that part is "***on track***".

<!-- insert video montage of construction work here ... -->

<hr />

## How Far Along?

##### How far along are you? `<textarea maxlength="250">`

The first **`home`** building is 65% construction-complete.
(Architect designs & progress photos on website)
We have built several components of our Mobile App (PWA)
but do not yet have an MVP we can test with users;
we plan to make it during Startup School. [249 chars]


<hr />

## Incorporated: No

##### Have you incorporated your company?* [yes/no]

For the purposes of the "Co-living" project,
we do not have a dedicated company for **`home`**.
Until now we have been funding it through operating cashflow/surplus
from our existing company (@dwyl) as well as personal equity.

We are open to advice whether we should form a new company
(_we are leaning towards a new company..._)
we have a "four-letter-dotcom" domain: [dwyl.com](https://dwyl.com)
and the corresponding "social accounts" e.g: https://twitter.com/dwyl
which we feel would be a "waste" to _abandon_.

If our advisors think we can "pivot" (repurpose) the `@dwyl` brand
we'd be happy to do that.

There is some "overlap", given that **`home`** is helping
people discover and do what they love.



# tl;dr

We like to think of **`home`** as a "***Pre-YC***"
place to learn creative/coding skills,
discover like-minded people and focus on solving big problems.

**`home`** is _not_ a "coding bootcamp" like "FullStack Academy" (YC S12)
and it's not an AirBnB (YC W09) it's
more akin to a Recurse Center (YC S10) https://www.recurse.com/
(_self-directed learning_)
meets cost-effective "high-end co-living",
with _privacy_ and plenty of space to think, exercise and get work _done_.

Our aim is to help people have a solid foundation
to launch their career in tech
either as an engineer or co-founder!

We believe that having a female-founder-focus
is _essential_ for achieving "balance" in the tech industry
and is _congruent_ with YC's mission.

We are planning to have a "**hack space**" or "Design & Technology Lab"
which is a 50m<sup>2</sup> filled with prototyping tools/machines
including a Laser cutter, CNC machine, 3D printers and wide range of
tools for making furniture, electronics projects and other "hardware hacking".

_Please_ YC decision-makers, give us a space on Startup School
so that we can benefit from mentorship and
be part of your _incredible_ network.


_Thank you_!

This is what "_rejection_" looks like: 😞

And this is what it looks like when someone realises
that "_the software_" made a "mistake":

# `#accepted`

We don't know if this was a "Fluke" or if the YC partners
_actually_ liked our application ... but we'll take it!
