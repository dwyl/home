# rehab

Often we can derive as much insight
from the decision people make
to _not_ do something
as we do from what the ended up _doing_.







Lately I've been _seriously_ considering the name **`ReHab`** for the house ðŸ’­
And before you dismiss it summarily, allow me to explain _why_!

The word "rehab" is short for ["rehabilitation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation).  Rehabilitation is a branch of medicine that aims to enhance and restore functional ability to those with physical impairments or disabilities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation
The term rehabilitation existed in the medical field _long_ before it became associated with addiction to toxic substances and for the most part it still has a _positive_ association.

A Google _image_ search for "**rehabilitation**" shows an exclusively _positive_ image for the word:

My _reasoning_ for thinking the name is _good_ is that it works on several levels.
Firstly, we are _absolutely_ going to help people _recover_ their health and build healthy habits for sleep, nutrition and exercise
by building an _environment_ where good choices are the **`default`**.
Secondly we are helping people to _reset_ their lives and

At this point it's worth a minor detour to clarify "roadmap" for the house.
Our objective with all this is to create a community of like-minded people
who are focussed on health, happiness and building
Crucially
When we open the house we will _not_ be allowing _anyone/everyone_ to stay without _any_ filtering.
That would be _guarantee_ chaos and cause the whole project to fail.

The word "rehab" has come to be associated with rehabilitation (_breaking addiction_) from substance abuse including chemical dependence ([alcohol](https://github.com/dwyl/health/issues/48), drugs and nicotine) but is increasingly used to describe rehabilitation from mental health issues and eating disorders.

While researching this, I did a quick check on Unsplash (_free stock photos_) to see if I could find a good intro image .... There are only a handful of images and this is one of the most popular:

Regardless of how you feel about _substance_ abuse/addiction rehabilitation centers, if you have never identified with the _sentiment_ of wanting to give up, feeling lonely or aimless you're either _incredibly lucky_ or in denial or _both_. The


## interesting aside: "rehab" in popular music

Amy Winehouse wrote the autobiographical song "Rehab" in **2006** after years of struggling alcohol addiction. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehab_(Amy_Winehouse_song)
The lyrics are very catchy/memorable. The song starts with the chorus and the first verse is insightful into how Amy was thinking at the time:

> "_They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "no, no, no"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my **daddy thinks I'm fine**
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go_

> _I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I **ain't got seventy days**
'Cause there's nothing, **there's nothing you can teach me**
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway_"
> ...

If only [Amy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Winehouse) had invested the 70 days to _reset_ her health, she might be alive and making great music today!

The chorus line "***daddy thinks I'm fine***" refers to the fact that Amy's father Mitch (_himself an _), walked out on the family when Amy was 9, consistently denied that his daughter was an alcoholic. In an interview in February 2007 Mitch admitted that Amy ["_sometimes overdid the drink_"] ...

Amyâ€™s boyfriend and later husband, [Blake Fielder-Civil](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8009075/amy-winehouses-ex-husband-blake-fielder-civil-went-from-showbiz-parties-and-luxury-holidays-to-stealing-from-a-barmaid-while-living-on-a-crime-ridden-estate/) was also central to her downward spiral. They met in a bar in London in 2005 and he introduced Amy to hard drugs and fuelled her addiction by supplying her with heroin while she was in rehab in mid 2007. It's unquestionable that Blake _negatively_ influenced Amy. Their relationship was toxic and it indirectly lead to her untimely demise in 2011 (_two years after their divorce_).

"***Mr. Hathaway***" refers to soul legend [Donny Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_Hathaway) who after suffering from from [paranoid schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_schizophrenia), died at age 33 after a fall from the 15th story of New York's Essex House hotel.

Rihanna (ft. Justin Timberlake) released her single "Rehab" on October 6, 2008 almost exactly a year after Amy's single: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehab_(Rihanna_song)

> "_I gotta check into rehab
Cause, **baby, you're my disease**_"
...
> "_Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like **you were my favorite drug**
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you_"

This song is a clear reminder of how _addictive_ relationships can be destructive.

To be clear: I don't think the name **`rehab`** is the _perfect_ name for what we are trying to build because it can have several _negative_ associations. The _last_ thing I/we want is to be thought of as a Drug/Alcohol rehabilitation center and thus attracting people who are in recovery from years of chemical dependence who we are _not_ equipped/qualified to support!

I just think the word "_works_" on several levels and we _could_ be instrumental in reassigning the _meaning_ of the word back to something a _lot_ more positive! I don't think that any _parent_ would want their child who does _not_ have any addiction issues visiting (_staying at_) a place called "rehab".
But then again ... how many teens/young adults are _not_ addicted to social media, games or other forms of [instant](https://github.com/dwyl/home/issues/29) gratification/entertainment these days? Isn't it every bit as destructive to long-term health as substances?
Maybe the _demand_ for "rehab" (_detox from **socially acceptable** but highly addictive things such as sugar, alcohol, nicotine, online activities and **toxic relationships**_) amongst millennials is _much_ greater than any official (_available_) stats suggest ...

Some people are spending _substantial_ portions of their day on social media:
